    "description": "Africa‚Äôs highest peak seems more striking than a lot of other famous mountains, because it‚Äôs an ancient stratovolcano that‚Äôs not part of any mountain range. That means the 19,000-foot summit drops down to vast, flat plains on all sides, making it a mirage-like blip on Tanzania‚Äôs widespread topography.

The two volcanic peaks‚ÄîGros Piton and Petit Piton‚Äîare the most iconic landmarks on the island, and visitors can enjoy them in a variety of ways. A singular experience has to be actually hiking the mountains, an activity which takes the better part of a day.
